# Project 5 MindfulLife Application README File (My Contribution- Sensor Data Integeration)
Welcome to the Project 5 MindfulLife Application repository. This Android application serves as a comprehensive health monitoring solution, offering real-time measurements of respiratory rate, heart rate, and simulated sleep cycles.

The Project 5 MindfulLife is designed to be your digital health assistant, providing insights into vital health metrics for proactive management. The main components, especially MainActivity, facilitate the core functionalities of the app, aligning seamlessly with the Guardian Angel concept.

Respiratory Rate Monitoring:
Utilizes accelerometer data for real-time tracking of respiratory rate.
Calculates breath count and updates the UI dynamically.

Heart Rate Measurement:
Harnesses the device camera to simulate heart rate monitoring.
Provides simulated heart rate data for user awareness.
Simulated Sleep Monitoring:

Simulates changes in respiratory rate over time to analyze sleep cycles.
Classifies sleep based on predefined respiratory rate thresholds.

Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
Navigate to the cloned repository and open the respective directory.
Build and Run:

Build the project using Android Studio.
Run the app on an emulator or a connected Android device.
Launch the app to access the main screen with buttons for different health monitoring features.
Press the "Measure Respiratory Rate" button to initiate real-time respiratory rate monitoring.
The "Measure Heart Rate" button triggers simulated heart rate measurement using the device camera.
Explore the simulated sleep monitoring by clicking the corresponding button.
